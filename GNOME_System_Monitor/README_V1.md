# My GNOME System Monitor experience

This directory contains my GNOME System Monitor pictures from all of 2020 to 2021.

I started getting these screenshots on my new Linux system (July 9th 2020) I started getting end of day recap pictures starting September 19th 2020.

It turned into a daily tradition from this pointward onward.

## Some notes

1. Screenshots for 2020 to 2021 are in 1920x1200 resolution 

2. These pictures are of the GNOME System Monitor on Linux/Ubuntu 20.04 with the GNOME 3.36.1 desktop environment.

3. Dark theme is used by default. I do not offer light mode screenshots

4. Images are in PNG format

5. I take these pictures at the end of the day before shutting my laptop down. Sometimes pictures will be taken before system restarts, or to document a hard drive backup

6. Every once in a while, I change the color of the CPU, RAM, and network graphs.

7. No other notes for this month
