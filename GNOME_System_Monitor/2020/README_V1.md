# My 2020 GNOME System Monitor experience

This directory contains my GNOME System Monitor end of day recap pictures from 2020.

Images from 2020 are done on a daily basis from September 19th 2020 to December 31st 2020, but there are over a dozen images from before this.

I started getting these screenshots daily on September 19th 2020. Before this, it was only done for events.

It turned into a daily tradition from this point onward.

## Some notes

1. I got screenshots for this year from ?? 2020 to December 31st 2020
 
2. Screenshots for this year are in 1920x1200 resolution 

3. These pictures are of the GNOME System Monitor on Linux/Ubuntu 20.04 with the GNOME 3.36.1 desktop environment.

4. Dark theme is used by default. I do not offer light mode screenshots

5. Images are in PNG format

6. I take these pictures at the end of the day before shutting my laptop down. Sometimes pictures will be taken before system restarts, or to document a hard drive backup

7. Every once in a while, I change the color of the CPU, RAM, and network graphs.

8. No other notes for this month
